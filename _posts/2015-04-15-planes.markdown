It was the most well-kept mummy he had ever seen. But, that was not what was bothering him. Babur. He could not believe himself. He was a trained archaeologist. And, he had seen lot of interesting artifacts in his life. But, nothing comes as close. He was out of his elements.

He decided to take a break. He went outside and started smoking. As he saw the cigarette smoke vanishing in the air, he tried to find an answer. He knew about all ancient civilizations and medieval ones. He was not alien to the fact that Egyptian civilization was not the only civilization which had mummies.

But, Babur. He used to think that Babur was peaceful in his grave in Kabul. How on earth has his agent brought this mummy to him ? Was his assistant wrong in identifying the mummy? But, he trusted Greg. He was the best in the city.

Babur was the founder of the great Mughal dynasty in South Asia. He was the grandson of Timor and Genghis Khan, the two most fearsome people on the planet, or at least Asia. How could his body come here ? He was thinking of what this information could mean. This can cause unrest in West Asia and South Asia. There would be a new wave of mistrust about the West. This can mean the end of his career.
