Sophia was nervous. She hardly knew Nathan. And she was going to tie the knot with him. She had to utter the words “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part”, she would be with him.

But how could she say those words without meaning them. She had loved Richard with all her heart but he had left her. He had not left her for another girl. Richard was not a man like that. But, he had said he needed few years to clear his head, and he wanted to travel the world. He said he would not tell her to wait as he knew she cannot wait. She had to get married by 28 to get the property her dad had left for her.

Then, she had heard that her college professor finding her husband from a dating site. Also, few of her friends had found nice boring guys on LetsDate.com. So she had brought herself to creating a profile. She was overwhelmed with guys messaging her, and most of the messages were obscene comments or pictures. She was on the verge of deleting her profile when Nathan had messaged her.

Nathan was from Belarus. After talking with him, she realized that he was just looking to marry an American girl to get a green-card as he could not get a work visa by lottery. And, he was honest about that, and wanted to pay 10 grands for the marriage. Sophia did not need the money but he did not want Nathan to take this for granted. So, she accepted his offer.

Sophia was feeling very guilty. They were clear that as they were not having a regular wedding, they can see other people. Nathan had told her to wait till the wedding was over. Sophia had a friends with benefits with her neighbor Josh. They could never keep their hands off each other.

Just to the east, where the highway ended in a dusty turnabout surrounded by sage-brush, Sophia turned her car.

Nathan's mother Maria had walked on them. Nathan had told her mother that he was living in with Sophia in her apartment, as Maria was a traditional woman and could never understand this marriage of convenience. Nathan's marriage tux was in Sophia's apartment and Maria went to collect it from Sophia. As this was work hours for Sophia, Nathan had given his keys to Maria. And when Maria entered the apartment he found Sophia lying over Josh. Maria had shrieked "Jesus...what a whore" and some other curses in Belarusian and had left the building screaming and yelling as she had went down the stairs.

Sophia did not know what to do. She had only option. She wanted to run away. Only one place came to her Vegas. She can probably find someone to marry her there. She had seen that in a movie. After all, the court order said nothing about getting married in California. She wore her jeans and t-shirt and hopped onto her car, and drove. She had left in a jiffy, and had not realized that her phone was dying. She realized that she did not have the charger in her car, and she knew she was doomed. Without a GPS, it was insane driving through the Nevada desert.

Now she was feeling hot and thirsty. She had not anticipated the trouble she would get into. She hoped against hope that probably a knight in shining armor would come to protect the damsel in distress. Then she thought, she was a damsel in distress but she did not need a man to rescue her out of this mess. She just had to keep driving in one direction. and she would be fine. She knew that at some point she would run out of gas. But till then, she could keep driving. She had to reach Vegas before night fall. The dusty road was not safe in the night.

Suddenly, her car decelerated and came to a stand-still. She was sweating profusely, and the hot dusty wind was blowing. She could hardly see something in the desert storm. She was regretting not bringing her iPhone charger. She regretted her entire life. She could have married Richard and then traveled the world with him. Then she kicked her car. She realized her leg was hurting bad. And she tried to look at her leg, then she realized she was on her bed dreaming. Her dad came to her room telling her that she was running late for school.
